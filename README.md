Recieve POP3 email without using mswinsck.ocx using pure Windows API's

Hai friends..

Its me again...few days ago i had submitted a code on how to send SMTP email without using winsock.ocx and just pure windows API calls......I got lots of comments on that and some of you requested a similar POP( Post Office Protocol ) email reciever.....Here is an untested version of POP email reciever.....I have done test with my own mail server and machine but not on the internet.....You guys should do that part.....I will soon update the code if it contains any errors....but for now this is it.........Also all you have to do is to include popmail.bas and winsock.bas to your project and just call the popconnect, getmail functions which i have written....The small bug in my earlier program has been debugged and the thing is working fine...Do send in your comments and bug reports at josephninan@crosswinds.net.....And do vote for me.....

Bye for now

Joseph
